    <h3>The climate and geology of our planet have changed over hundreds of millions of years, causing <br/>
        dramatic changes in life forms on earth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Geological time provides sufficent time for the process of natural selction to create <br/>
            large-scale changes in organisims</li>
        <li>About 1.7 milion species have been described, and millions more await descoverty</li>
        <li>Current species on earth account for &approx;1%</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The fossil recod documents the history of life on Earth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fossils are the preserved remains of impressins of individual organisms that lived in the past, <br/>
             and are often found in sedimentay rock</li>
        <li>Older fossils are found in deeper, older rock layers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estimation of fossil ages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Absolute dating <br/>
            <ul><li>Radoisotopes (Radioactive Half-life)</li></ul>

    <h3>The fossil record is not complete</h3>
    <p>The fossil record contains many gaps because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most organsims decompose rapidly after death and do not form fossils</li>
        <li>Organisms may not live near areas where sediments typically form</li>
        <li>Those fossils that are formed can be destroyed by common Geological processes such as <br/>
            erosion and extreme heat or pressure</li>
        <li>Fossils are hard to find</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fossils revela that whales are closely related to a group of hoffed mammals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Whales have relative complete fossil record, which enables scientists to observe<br/>
            many transitional forms that document their evolutionary past
        </li>
        <li>Whales show the greatest DAN similarity to artiodactyls, which are even-toed, <br/>
        hooved land mammals (such as hippos, camels, and giraffes) </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Single-celled life appeared by 3.5 billion years ago</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth rocks as old as 3.8 billion years old contain carbon deposists that hint at life.</li>
        <li>Cell-like structures have been found in stromatolites that formed 3.5 billion years ago</li>
        <li>... more</li>

    <h3>The evolution of oxygen-productin phhotosynthesis was on tof the most importanty <br/>
    events in the history of life on earth</h3>

    <h3>Mulicellular life evlved around 650 million years ago</h3>
    <img src="../../link_img/History-of-life-on-Earth-.jpg">

    <h3>Cambrian Period<br/>multiple adaptive radiations of animal life</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting in the early to middle Cambrian period, 530 mya, there was a <br/>
        dramatic increase in the diversity of anumal life, known as the Cambrian explosion <br/>
        which lasted only 5-10 million years</li>
        <li>THe presence of new predtors may have created the need for natural selection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Colonization of land followed the Cambrian Expolsion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Green alae were the first organisms to colonize land about 500 mya(million years ago)</li>
        <li>PLants covered Earth by the end of the Devonian period, 360 mya</li>
        <li>Fungi appeared on land at about the same time as plants; the two groups developed <br/>
        mutualisms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Waterproofing, effiecent transport mechanisms and roots helped land plants <br/>
    acquire and conserve water</h3>
    <p>Land plants evloved key innovations to deal with the challenges of terrestrial lif:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water proof cuticles</li>
        <li>... more</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Amphibians, the first VERTERBRATES to colonize land, and thought to have decended<br/>
    frm lobe-finned fishes</h3>
    <img src="../../link_img/tetrapods.jpg">

    <h3>Reptiles evolved from amphibians and were the first to evolve the amniotic sac</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No need for going back to water to reproduce</li>
        <li>Mammals, the dominant vertebrate group on land currently, evolved from <br/>
        reptiles roughly 220 mya</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mass Extinctions: Worldwide Losses of Species</h3>
    <img src="../../link_img/mass_extinctions.png">
    <ul>
        <li>The fossil record shows that there have been five mass extinctions, periods <br/>
        of time during which great numbers of species went extinct throughout most of Earth</li>
        <li>Each mass extinction has left a permante martk on the history of life</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The extinction of one or more groups of organisms can provide new ecological <br/>
    and evolutionary opportunities for other groups of organisms.</h3>

    <h2>Macroevolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Organisms differ radically in form, in embryological development, in body plans,<br/>
        and in ecology</li>
        <li><b>Microevolution</b> is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within<br/>
             a population</li>
        <li><b>Macroevolution</b> refers to large-scale changes in organisms, generally occurring <br/>
        over millions of years</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../link_img/whale_evo.jpg">

    <h3>Factors Causing Macroevolution</h3>
    <p><b>Geologic timescale - used to be considered the only factor</b><br/></p>
    <p>Dramatic macroevolutionary changes can ocurr over geological timescales because<br/>
    of its immense magnitued and also because geologic processes can alter the position of continetns, <br/>
    cause shifts in atmospheric composition, and produce large-scale changes</p>

    <h3>Rapid Macroevolution through Differential Gene Expression</h3>
    <p>The relatively new field of evo-devo has demonstrated that changes in patterns of gene expression can bring <br/>
    about dramatic changes in from</p>

    <h3>Macroevolution does not necessarily require vast timescales in order to produce large changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A small alteration in the expression of a single homeotic gene can rapidly lead to a significant <br/>
        phenotypic change and interoduce a completely novel vertebrate body plan.</li>
        <li>Homeotic genes control deveopment of whole body segments or structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Difference in patterns of gene expression explan many of the differnce between chimps and humans</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Human and chimpanzee genomes are approximately 98 percent similar</li>
        <li>Humans have same genes for hair growth that a chimpanzee has, but these gene are only expressed<br/>
        in certain ares</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Similarities between organisms can be used to infer their evolutionary histories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Organizing and classify the tremendous diverity of life on Earth is the focus of a discipline called txonomy</li>
        <li>An evolutionary tree ...</li>
        <li>The goal of phylogenetics is to construct evolutionary trees that illustrate the pattersn of species evolution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>An evolutionary tree maps the relationships between ancestral groups and their descendants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Living things have diversified into many lines of descent, or lineages, that have evolved into many different types of organisims<br/>
        some of them now extinct</li>
        <li>THe node represents the most recent common ancesotr of the two lineages in question- that is, the most immediate ancestor that both lineages share</li>
        <li>A given ancestor and all its descendants make up a clade, or branch, on an evolutionary tree</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../link_img/primatetree.png">

    <h3>Shared derived traits are evolutionary novelties tha reveal relatedness among species</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>THe most useful characteristics for discerning evolutionary relationships are unique features that are found in a groups<br/>
        most recent common ascestor</li>
        <li>Shared derved traits (homogous traits) are evolutionary novelties shared by an ancestor and its descendants but not seen in groups that <br/>
        are not direct descendants of that ancestor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Linnean System of Biological Classification</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Taxonomy (Linnaean Hierarchy)</b> began by Carolus Linnaeus. Published 1735</li>
        <li>The species is the smallest unit (lowest level) of classification in the Linnaean hierarchy</li>
        <li>Closely related species are grouped togther in genous</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Clasdistic taxonomy: </b> classification based on evolutionary relationships</p>
    <p><b>Clade:</b> a branch on a phylogenetic tree</p>

    <h3>What are species</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Biological Species Concept defines a species as "members of populations that actually or potentially interbreed in nature." 
            <br/>
            <ul><li>Interbreeding &rAarr; producing viable/fertile offspring</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Evolutionary Species Concept defines a species as "al lineage evolving seperately from others and with it's own unitary role and tendencies."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reproductive isolation
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Post-zygotic:</b> Individuals are able to reproduce living, but steril offstprin</li>
        <li><b>Pre-sygotic:</b> Individuals are unable to fertilize each other's gametes, or even unable to copulate at all</li>
    </ul>
