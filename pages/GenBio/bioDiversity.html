        <h2>Info about Prokayotes</h2>
        <h3>Prokaytoes reproduce asexually - binary fission</h3>
        <img src="../../link_img/binary-fission.jpg">

        <h3>Some prokayotes show social behaviors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The communication system that enables microbes to coordinate their behavior <br/>
            in repsonse to chell density is called quorum sensing.</li>
            <li>Upon sensing in a quorum, aggregated bacteria attach themselves to their surroundings</li>
            <li>Attached bacteria now divide explosively to create a tough, slime-covered aggregate <br/>
            call bio film</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prokayotes can take up genetic material from their enviornment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some prokaryotes can take up DNA from their enviornment and incorporate it into <br/>
            own DNA, a process know as transformation</li>
            <li>DNA can trasferred from on bacterial cell to another through bacterial conjugation</li>
            <li>Lateral gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material between different species<br/>
            under natural conditions</li>
            <li>Lateral gene transfer through these and other mechanisms increases genetic diversity and<br/>
            has sped up the rate of evolution in prokaryotes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prokayotesare unrivaled in metabolic diversity</h3>
        <img src="../../link_img/prokayot-metabolic-div.jpg">

        <h3>Autotrophs make food from carbon dioxide, using energy from light or air</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some prokaryotes are chemoautotrophs:</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Heterotrophs get carbon from organic matter and obtain energy from <br/>
        light or orgainic matter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Photoautrophs</li>
            <li>Chemoautrophs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prokaytes play important roles in the biosphere</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyanobacteria accounts for 20-30% of oxygen in the biosphere</li>
            <li>Some prokayotes are decomposers that break down materials</li>
            <li>Play a role in nitrogen fixation, assist plants with the decomposition of nitrogen</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prokaryotes play important roles for humans</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Of the trillions of cells in a human, about 90% belong to microorganisms (of microbes)<br/>
            that live on body surfaces and inside the intestines. -- human microbiome</li>
            <li>Symbiosis refers to the shared existence of two or more species; the microbes in <br/>
            our microbiome are mostly beneficial</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Some bacteria cause disease</h3>
        <img src="../../link_img/infectious_diseases_21485.png">

        <h3>Antibiotics help in the battle againse infectious diseases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Antibiotics are molecules produced by one organism that kill or slow the growth<br/>
            of another organism</li>
            <li>Antibiotics are naturally produced by a variety of fungi and some bacteria</li>
            <li>Bacteria and fungi often occupy the same ecological niche - that is, have the same<br/>
            habitat and food requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to selection for antibiotic resistance</h3>
        <ul><li>Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses</li></ul>
        <img src="../../link_img/resistance-antibiotics.jpeg">

        <h3>Viruses are non-living infectious agents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A virus is a microscopic, noncellular infectious particle</li>
            <li>Viruses contain genetic material, either DNA or RNA</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retroviruses can insert their genetic material into a host cell's DNA</h3>
        <ul><li>HIV is a retrovirus, whih inserts its genetic material into host cell's DNA and could remain<br/>
        dormant (latent_ for a long period of time</li></ul>
