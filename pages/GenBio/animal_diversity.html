        <h1>Diversity of Animals</h1>
</div>
<body>
  <h2>Choanoflagellates</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Sing-celled flagellated protists which are the closest living relatives of animals</li>
      <li>Form colonies, cooperative groups that are considered and eveolutionary stepping stone toward multicelluarity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Kingon Animalia</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Animals are ingestive heterotrophs: <br/>
            They obtain energy and carbon by bringing food into the body and digesting and absorbing it internally.
        </li>
        <li>All animals are consumers, and some are decomposers</li>
        <li>Animals exhibit locomotion (self-directed movement of the whole body) at some stage of the life cycle</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The evolutionary origins of animalia</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Spones are the oldest animal lineage, followed by the cnidarians, which include jellyfish and corals</li>
      <li>Protosomes and deuterostomes are two broad groups of animals, distinguished by the way their embryos develop<br/>

        </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Characteristics of Animals</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Animal cells lack a cell wall and instead most are attached to an <b>extracellular matrix</b></li>
      <li>Patches of proteins that make up <b>cell junctions</b> attach animal cells to each other and to <br/>
            the extracellular matrix
        </li>
        <li>All except sponges
            <ul>
                <li>Presence of true tissues</li>
                <li>Pattern of gastralation during embryo development</li>
                <li>Body symetry</li>
                <li>Organs and Organ systems</li>
                <li>Body cavities</li>
                <li>Semgentation of the body</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Most animals have true tissues</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Cnidarians are one of the firest animal groups to have evolved true tissues</li>
      <li>Specialized tissues facilitate complex animal behaviors</li>
      <li>Cnidarians have a network of interconnected nerve cells and ligh-sensitive regions know as eye spots</li>
      <li>Muscle tissue is found in all animals excpet sponges</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Most animals have symmetrical bodies</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Most animals exhibt either radial or bilateral symetry</li>
      <li>Radial symmetry gives sessile animals greater access to their enviornment</li>
      <li>Bilateral symmetry enables rapid and efficient locomotion</li>
      <li>Bilateral symmetry leads to cephalization, (cepha:head, cephalization=formation of head) the concentration of sensory at the anterior end,<br/>
        which made directional movement more effective</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Most animals (Protosomes and Deuterostomes) have organs and organ systems</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>An organ has  a definite shape, size, and location in the body</li>
      <li>Two or more organs working together form an organ system</li>
      <li>The evolotuion of organ systems has allowed animals to achieve more complex behaviors, including the ability to reflect on the nature of all life</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Some animals evolved complex body cavities</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Body cavities allow animals internal organs to grow freely and function indepenedently</li>
      <li>Most body cavities also provide padding, protection, and support for organs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Semgentation enables division of labor among bocy parts</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Many animals have repeated units called segments</li>
      <li>Appendages are specialized body parts taht arize from body segments and enable divers adaptations to new habitats or new modes of life</li>
  </ul>
