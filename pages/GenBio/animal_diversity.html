        <h1>Diversity of Animals</h1>
</div>
<body>
    <h2>Choanoflagellates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sing-celled flagellated protists which are the closest living relatives of animals</li>
        <li>Form colonies, cooperative groups that are considered and eveolutionary stepping stone toward multicelluarity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Kingon Animalia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Animals are ingestive heterotrophs: <br/>
                They obtain energy and carbon by bringing food into the body and digesting and absorbing it internally.
            </li>
            <li>All animals are consumers, and some are decomposers</li>
            <li>Animals exhibit locomotion (self-directed movement of the whole body) at some stage of the life cycle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The evolutionary origins of animalia</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spones are the oldest animal lineage, followed by the cnidarians, which include jellyfish and corals</li>
        <li>Protosomes and deuterostomes are two broad groups of animals, distinguished by the way their embryos develop<br/>
            <img src="../../link_img/bio/protosomesanddeuterosomes.jpg">
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Characteristics of Animals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Animal cells lack a cell wall and instead most are attached to an <b>extracellular matrix</b></li>
        <li>Patches of proteins that make up <b>cell junctions</b> attach animal cells to each other and to <br/>
                the extracellular matrix
            </li>
            <li>All except sponges
                <ul>
                    <li>Presence of true tissues</li>
                    <li>Pattern of gastralation during embryo development</li>
                    <li>Body symetry</li>
                    <li>Organs and Organ systems</li>
                    <li>Body cavities</li>
                    <li>Semgentation of the body</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Most animals have true tissues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cnidarians are one of the firest animal groups to have evolved true tissues</li>
        <li>Specialized tissues facilitate complex animal behaviors</li>
        <li>Cnidarians have a network of interconnected nerve cells and ligh-sensitive regions know as eye spots</li>
        <li>Muscle tissue is found in all animals excpet sponges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Most animals have symmetrical bodies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most animals exhibt either radial or bilateral symetry</li>
        <li>Radial symmetry gives sessile animals greater access to their enviornment</li>
        <li>Bilateral symmetry enables rapid and efficient locomotion</li>
        <li>Bilateral symmetry leads to cephalization, (cepha:head, cephalization=formation of head) the concentration of sensory at the anterior end,<br/>
            which made directional movement more effective</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Most animals (Protosomes and Deuterostomes) have organs and organ systems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An organ has  a definite shape, size, and location in the body</li>
        <li>Two or more organs working together form an organ system</li>
        <li>The evolotuion of organ systems has allowed animals to achieve more complex behaviors, including the ability to reflect on the nature of all life</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some animals evolved complex body cavities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Body cavities allow animals internal organs to grow freely and function indepenedently</li>
        <li>Most body cavities also provide padding, protection, and support for organs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Semgentation enables division of labor among body parts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Many animals have repeated units called segments</li>
        <li>Appendages are specialized body parts taht arize from body segments and enable divers adaptations to new habitats or new modes of life</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The First Invertebrates:<br/>Sponges, Jellyfish, and Relatives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Animal lineages diverge very early in animal evolution</li>
        <li>Sponges, jellyfish, corals are </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PORIFERA- Sponges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10,000 species in three main groups</li>
        <li>Exclusively aquatic, mostly marien</li>
        <li>Tiny to huge ( 15ft tall - loggerhead sponges)</li>
        <li>6 cell types in sponges (humans have >250)</li>
        <li>No true mouth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sponges are the simplest animals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sponges are filter feeders that feed on bacteria, amoebas, and other organisms they acquire from their enviornment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sponges have specialized cells, but lack true tissues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A sponge is a loose collectin of cells, witheach cell functioning largely indpenedntly from other cells</li>
        <li><b>Chonaocytes</b>, or collar cless, line the canals and interior chambers of sponges. </li>
        <li><b>Spicules</b> are sharp structures that help protect and provide structural support to sponges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sponge Reproduction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sexual and asexual</li>
        <li>Asexual - regeneation through breaking off pieces</li>
        <li>Sexual - some are monecious and some are dioecious</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sponge ecology</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Many are mutualists with fish, mites, snails</li>
        <li>Can grow on other animals</li>
        <li>Can be used as comouflage</li>
        <li>Few predators, including ony fish, turtles, some fly larvae</li>
        <li>Substrate limited competition; coral are competitiors</li>
    </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Discharge as a result of high osmotic pressure</li>
                    <li>Each cell operates independently</li>
                    <li>Discriminate in firing</li>
