<h1>Concept Check</h1>
<h3>The dystophin gene has 78 introns. Are these introns transcribed?</h3> 
<p>Yes, all 78 introns are transcribed, but not all were coded.</p>

<h3>Why is the start condon, AUG, so important?</h3>
<p>I starts the frame and sets the basis for every frame prior</p>

<h3>What does it mean to say that the genetic code is redundant</h3>
<p>There are 64 possible codons, only 20 protiens</p>

<h3>What is translation?</h3>
<p>Conversion from a strand of mRNA to a protien</p>

<h3>Does each of the 64 codons specify a different amino acid?</h3>
<p>there are 3 stop codons that don't code for anything</p>

<h3>What is a mutation? Are all mutations harmful?</h3>
<p>A change in the base sequence of DNA. No not all are harmful</p>

<h3>A signle-base addition or deletion in a gene is likely to alter the protein product more thna a signle-base
    substitution, such as C for T, would. Why?
</h3>
<p>Because of phase shifts</p>

<h3>Why are most genes controlled at the level of transcription?</h3>
<p>Transcriptional regulation prevents gene expression when a product is not needed by a cell, enabling the cell to invest resources
    elsewhere.
</p>

<h3>If transcriptional controll is the most favored method of gene regulation, why are not all genes controlled at the level of transcription</h3>
<p>Transcriptional activation is relatively slow; controlling gene expresion at a posttranscritional</p>

<h3>What is gene expression</h3>
<p>The whole process wheicha gene produces a phenotype.</p>

<h3>Is the geneome of your neurons (nerve cells) indentical to that of your liver cells</h3>
<p>Yes, all cells have the same basic genome</p>

<h3>We have at lease 21,000 protn-coding genes. Are all of these genes expressed in each of your neurons (nerve cells)?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>What is the perecentage of thymene (T) in a DNA double helix which 20 precent of the nitrogenous bases are guanine (G)?</h3>
<p>30%</p>

<h3>If all genes are composd of just 4 nucleoutides, how can diffent genes carry diffetent information?</h3>
<p>different order and lengths</p>

<h3>What key function is performed by DNA polymerase?</h3>
<h3>Where is the enzyme found  in eukaryotic cells</h3>
<p>enyzme, nucleous</p>

<h3>What is meant by the "semi" in semiconservative replication?</h3>

<h3>What mechanisms reduce the chance of DNA mutation? Arte thsi mechanisms 100 percent effective?</h3>

<h3>Is all noncoding DNA useless "junk DNA"?</h3>
<p>No. Noncoding DNA can regulate gene expression, have structral functions, and serve as a connector (intron) between segments in a single gene. However, the function of most
    non-coding dna is unknown
</p>

<h3>What is the adaptive value of gene regulation?</h3>
<p>It allows us to prevent waste of resources and respond to changes in the enviornment</p>
