    <h2>RNA molecules are single-stranded poly nucleotides</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Like DNA, RNA is a polymer of nucleotides</li>
        <li>RNA is single-stranded</li>
        <li>DNA and RNA also differ in the type of sugar used (ribose in RN, Deoxyribose in DNA)</li>

<div>
    <h2>Transcription: INformation flow from DNA to RNA</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds to a segment of DNA called a gene promoter</li>
        <li>Once bound, RNA polymerase begins to unwind the DNA and transcribe the template strand (bottom strand in 
            in diagram); which strand serves as the template is dictated by the position of the promoter, which orients the polymerase.
        </li>
        <li>Transcription stops when RNA polymerase reaches a special sequence of baes called a terminator.</li>

<div>
    <h2>In eukaryotes, mRNA is chemically modified after transcription</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Posttranscriptional processing modifies RNA and prepares it for export from nucleus</li>
        <li>The newly formed mRNA underges RNA splicing, which removes the intron, and is then alled to leave the nucleus through the nuclear pore</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Translation: infomration flow from mRNA to protein</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Translation is the process of converting a sequence of bases in mRNA to sequnce of amino acids in protien</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>The base sequence of mRNA is read as a sequence of codons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each unique sequence of thre bases is called a codon></li>
        <li>When reading the code the reibsones begin at the start codon, AUG, and end at one of three stop codons: UAA, UAG, or UGA</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>There are 64 codons that make up the information in the genetic code</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The genetic code has several distinct charactersics
            <ul>
                <li>It is unambiguous</li>
                <li>it is redundant</li>
                <li>It is virtually universal</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>After a ribosome bonds to the mRNA, each specific amino acis is delieverd to the ribosome-mRNA complex by
        a tRNA molecule specialized to deliver a specific type of amino acid
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each codon on the mRNA is recognized by a specific tRNA, and the ribosome adds the amino acid deliverd by tRNA to the 
            growing amino acid chain

    <h2>A mutation is a change in the base sequence of an individual's DNA</h2>

        <li>insertion - </li>

        <li>substitution - </li>

    <h2>Mutation can alter protien function</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Even a single-base changes can alger protein function enough to produce a harmful phenotype such as a disease</li>
        <li>Rarely, a mutation cn be beneficial and imporve the efficiency or functionality of a protien</li>

<div>
    <h2>Insertion and deletion utations are ususally more disruptive than substitution mutations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Insertion or deletion mutations occur when a base is inserted into or deleted from a DNA sequene</li>
        <li>Insertion or deletion of one or two nucleotides causes a frameshift mutation, which scrambles the dwonstream RNA transcription</li>

    <h2>How cells control gene expression</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gene expression referes to the transcription and translatin of a gene to produce a functional protien that has an effect of phenotype</li>
        <li>Gene propoters are sections of a gene that function as an on/off swithc from transcription</li>
        <li>Gene expression changes during development and can change in response to enviornmental signals and internal signals such as hormones</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>In eukaryotes, different cell types express different sets of genes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Different types of cells express diffent sets of genes depending on wheter that gene function is needed under the prevailing conidions</li>
        <li>Housekeeping genes play an essential role in the maintenance of cellular activities in all kinds of cells and have been highly conserved in 
            evolutionary
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Most genes are controlled at the the transcriptional level</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cells generally control gene expression by regulating the transcription of specifi genes</li>
        <li>Regulatory DNA is the part of a gene that controls gene transcriptin with the help of gene regulator protiens</li>
        <li>.....</li>
