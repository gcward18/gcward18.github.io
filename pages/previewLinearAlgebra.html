<h3>Definition Vector Space:</h3>
<p>is a set of Vectors (v) on which is defined a set of operation, (+) and (*), vector addition and scalar multiplication,
    in conjunction with a set of scalars.

    <li>V is closed under (+)</li>
    <ol>
            <li> a(+)b = b(+)a, for all a,b in V</li>
            <li> (a(+)b)(+)g = a(+)(b(+)g), for all a,b,g in V</li>
            <li> a(+)0 = 0(+)a = a<, all a in V, and 0 in V, there has to be a "zero" element in V </li>
            <li> a(+)0 = 0(+)a = a<, all a in V, and 0 in V, there has to be a "zero" element in V </li>
            <li> all a in V there exists - a in V such that a(*)-a = -a(+) = 0 </li>
