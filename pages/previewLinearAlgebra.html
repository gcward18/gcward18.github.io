<h3>Definition Vector Space:</h3>
<p>is a set of Vectors (v) on which is defined a set of operation, &plus; and &sdot; , vector addition and scalar multiplication,
    in conjunction with a set of scalars. 
</p>

<ol>
    <li>V is closed under &plus;</li>
    <ol>
            <li>a &plus; b = b&plus;a, &forall; a,b &isin; V</li>
            <li> (a&plus;b)&plus;g = a&plus;(b&plus;g), &forall; a,b,g &isin; V</li>
            <li> a&plus;0 = 0&plus;a = a&lt;, all a &isin; V, and 0 &isin; V, there has to be a "zero" element &isin; V </li>
            <li> a&plus;0 = 0&plus;a = a&lt;, all a &isin; V, and 0 &isin; V, there has to be a "zero" element &isin; V </li>
            <li> all a &isin; V &exist; - a &isin; V such that a&sdot;-a = -a&plus; = 0 </li>
