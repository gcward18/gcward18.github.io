    <h2>The Whole Earth is One Biosphere-</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>biosphere</b> includes all the organisms on Earth, together with the physical enviornments in which they live</li>
        <!-- <li><b>Ecology</b> is the scientific study of interactions between</li> -->
    </ul>

    <h2>Biomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Biomes</b> can be categorized based on the uniqe climatic and ecological features of each such region</li>
        <li>A biome can encompass mor ethan one ecosystem but typically stetches across large swaths of the globe</li>
        <li>Terrestrial biomes are land biomes are usually named after the dominant vegetation in the area</li>
        <li>Aquatic biomes are found in water and are classified on the basis of physical and chemical features, such as salt content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Climate has the Bigggest Influence on the Location of the Terrtrial Biomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tundra: Cold Winters and a short growing season
            <ul>
                <li>Trese are scare dominated by low-growing flowering plants, such as grasses sedges, moss, and lichens</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Boreal Forest: Few Coniferous Species Dominate
            <ul>
                <li>Larges  terrestrial biome</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li> Temperate Deciduous Forests: have fertile soils and relatively mild winters
            <ul>
                <li>Greater species diversity</li>
                <li>Distinct months</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Grasslands: Appear in regions with good soil but relatively little moisture
        </li>
    </ul>
